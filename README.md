## Notice

Recently the plug-in management of this repository was migrated from `packer nvim` to `lazy nvim`.

Since tag: `2.0.0`. You can get older versions from the `1.x.x` branch. And the [origin readme](ORIGIN_README.md).

Cause `packer nvim` is not maintained anymore.

## Reason

I used to develop with Vim, but installing the code completion plugin (YouCompleteMe) and CSTags was too much of a hassle (those who have installed them before should deeply understand).

Therefore, I decided to switch to Neovim. There are several benefits:

1. Easier configuration management.
2. In case of future computer environment migration, Neovim is more convenient.
3. Minimalist configuration. Only 20+ plugins are installed
3. Faster startup speed ( **40-50ms** ).

## Requirements

- neovim `>= 0.10.0`
- lua `>= 5.2.0`
- nodejs `>= 20.0.0`

## Usage

First back up your original configuration information.

And then:

```shell
rm -rf ~/.config/nvim/
cd ~/.config
git clone git@github.com:here-Leslie-Lau/my-nvim.git
mv my-nvim nvim
```

Then, open any file with Neovim, wait for a few seconds, and the plugins will be installed automatically.

Install the language server protocol (LSP) for your programming language (Optional).

Option 1: Run the script in shell.

```shell
sh ~/.config/nvim/shells/lsp_install.sh
```

Option 2: Run the following command in Neovim.

```shell
:MasonInstall <your code language server protocol...>
```

Tips(2025-04-09): I'm using `mason.nvim`. Currently, the installed lsp includes `gopls, clangd, lua-language-server, buf_ls, taplo`. If the programming language you need is not available, you can refer to the [official website](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/configs.md). And then change the lsp in `lua/config/lsp.lua` to your needs.

```lua
for _, val in ipairs({ <your code language server protocol> }) do
--- some lua code
```

## Keymaps

First, let me explain that my \<leader\> key is set to `\`

You can modify the keybindings to your preferences in file `lua/config/lazy.lua`:

```lua
vim.g.mapleader = "\\"
```

You can modify the shortcut keys in file `lua/config/keymaps.lua` or `lua/config/lsp.lua`.
